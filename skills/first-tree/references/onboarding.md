# Context Tree Onboarding

You are setting up a **Context Tree** — the living source of truth for an organization. This document tells you what it is and how to bootstrap one.

---

## What Is a Context Tree

A Context Tree is a Git repository where every directory is a **domain** and every file is a **node**. Each node captures decisions, designs, and cross-domain relationships — the knowledge that would otherwise scatter across PRs, documents, and people's heads.

Key properties:

- **Nodes are markdown files.** Each directory has a `NODE.md` that describes the domain. Leaf `.md` files capture specific decisions or designs.
- **Every node has an owner.** Declared in YAML frontmatter. Owners approve changes to their nodes.
- **Organized by concern, not by repo or team.** An agent working on "add SSO" finds all auth context in one place — not split across 4 repos.
- **The tree is never a snapshot — it's the current state.** When decisions change, the tree updates. Stale nodes are bugs.

### Frontmatter Format

Every node has frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Auth Architecture"
owners: [alice, bob]
soft_links: [/infrastructure/deployments]
---
```

- `owners` — who can approve changes. `owners: []` inherits from parent. `owners: [*]` means anyone.
- `soft_links` — cross-references to related nodes in other domains.

### What Belongs in the Tree

Information an agent needs to **decide** on an approach — not to execute it.

**Yes:** "Auth spans 4 repos: backend issues JWTs, frontend uses Better Auth, extension uses OAuth popup, desktop uses localhost callback."

**No:** The function signature of `auth_service.verify()` — that's in the code.

---

## Four Principles

1. **Source of truth for decisions, not execution.** The tree captures the *what* and *why*. Execution details stay in source systems.
2. **Agents are first-class participants.** The tree is designed for agents to navigate and update.
3. **Transparency by default.** Reading is open to all. Writing requires owner approval.
4. **Git-native.** Nodes are files, domains are directories. History, ownership, and review follow Git conventions.

## How to Set Up a Context Tree

### Prerequisites

- A source/workspace Git repository, or an already-created dedicated tree repo
- Node.js 18+
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) if you want `first-tree publish` to create the remote
  `*-tree` repo and open the source-repo PR for you
- The npm package and installed CLI command are both `first-tree`.
- `first-tree init` installs the framework skill into
  `.agents/skills/first-tree/` and `.claude/skills/first-tree/` in a
  source/workspace repo.
- Use `npx first-tree init` for one-off runs, or `npm install -g first-tree`
  to add the `first-tree` command to your PATH

### Step 1: Initialize

Recommended workflow: run `first-tree init` from your source or workspace repo.
The CLI will install the bundled skill in the current repo, create a root
`FIRST_TREE.md` symlink to `.agents/skills/first-tree/references/about.md`,
update `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` with a managed
`FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` section, and create a sibling dedicated tree
repo named `<repo>-tree` by default. If a sibling or bound `<repo>-context`
already exists, `init` reuses it instead of renaming it. Tree files are
scaffolded only in the dedicated tree repo.

```bash
cd my-org
first-tree init
cd ../my-org-tree
first-tree publish --open-pr
```

If you want the initial bootstrap to draft member nodes from repository
contributors, opt in explicitly:

```bash
first-tree init --seed-members contributors
```

If you already created a dedicated tree repo manually, initialize it in place:

```bash
mkdir my-org-tree && cd my-org-tree
git init
first-tree init --here
```

Only use `--here` after you have already switched into the dedicated tree repo.
Do not use it inside the source/workspace repo unless you intentionally want
that repo itself to become the Context Tree.

From a source/workspace repo, `init` installs `.agents/skills/first-tree/`,
`.claude/skills/first-tree/`, and the `FIRST_TREE.md` symlink only in that
source repo. The dedicated tree repo keeps its local metadata under
`.first-tree/`, renders scaffolding (`NODE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`members/NODE.md`), and generates a task list in `.first-tree/progress.md`.
When `--seed-members contributors` is set, init also attempts to create
`members/*/NODE.md` from GitHub contributor data and falls back to local git
history if GitHub metadata is unavailable.

Hard boundary: do **not** create `NODE.md`, `members/`, or tree-scoped
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` in the source/workspace repo. Those tree files
belong only in the dedicated `*-tree` repo. Existing dedicated `*-context`
repos are still supported and reused when already bound.

Default agent workflow after initialization:

1. Draft the initial tree version in the dedicated `*-tree` repo (or in the
   existing dedicated `*-context` repo if that is what the source repo already
   uses).
2. Run `first-tree publish --open-pr` from that dedicated tree repo. It will
   create or reuse the GitHub `*-tree` repo in the same owner/org as the
   source repo, continue supporting older `*-context` repos, record the
   published tree URL back in the source/workspace repo, refresh the ignored
   local tree checkout config, and open the source-repo PR.
3. After publish succeeds, treat the checkout recorded in
   `.first-tree/local-tree.json` as the canonical local working copy for the
   tree. The bootstrap checkout can be deleted when you no longer need it.

### Routine Work After Publish

- Start routine work by reading the source/workspace repo's
  `.first-tree/local-tree.json` file and resolving the recorded `localPath`.
- If that recorded checkout exists locally, update it before you read the
  tree.
- If the recorded checkout is missing but the tree has already been published,
  create a temporary clone inside `.first-tree/tmp/` in the current
  source/workspace repo, use it for the task, and delete it before finishing.
- Fall back to the sibling bootstrap checkout (`*-tree` by default, or legacy
  `*-context`) only before publish has recorded the GitHub URL and local tree
  config.
- At task close-out, always ask whether the tree needs updating.
- If the task changed decisions, constraints, rationale, or ownership, send
  the tree PR first. Then send the source/workspace code PR.
- If the task changed only implementation detail, skip the tree PR and send
  only the source/workspace code PR.

### Step 2: Work Through the Task List

Read `.first-tree/progress.md`. It contains a checklist tailored
to the current state of the repo. Complete each task:

- Fill in `NODE.md` with your organization name, owners, and domains
- Add project-specific instructions to `AGENTS.md` below the framework markers
- Create member nodes under `members/`
- Optionally configure agent integration in the source/workspace repo (for
  Claude Code, the installed hook assets live under
  `.claude/skills/first-tree/`)
- Copy any validation workflows you want from the source/workspace repo's
  `.agents/skills/first-tree/assets/framework/workflows/` directory into the
  tree repo's `.github/workflows/`

As you complete each task, check it off in
`.first-tree/progress.md` by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.

Treat `progress.md` as the source of truth for the post-onboarding checkpoint.
Before you ask whether to keep building out the tree, report what is already
done and what remains. Split that report into setup/integration progress and
tree-content baseline coverage progress, and describe the remaining work
categories instead of claiming the tree is "100% complete."

If you want a quick checkpoint while you are working in the dedicated tree
repo, run the shipped helper from the source/workspace repo and point it at the
tree repo's progress file:

```bash
node ../my-org/.agents/skills/first-tree/assets/framework/helpers/summarize-progress.js .first-tree/progress.md
```

If the user wants to continue after that checkpoint, explain the scope first
(for example: how many top-level domains you expect to cover, how many waves
of parallel work you plan to run, and that you will reconcile the root node,
cross-domain soft links, and `first-tree verify` at the end). Then use
wave-based parallel sub-tasks or subagents, usually one per top-level domain,
until each domain has a first-pass baseline `NODE.md`.

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
first-tree verify
```

Or, from your source/workspace repo:

```bash
first-tree verify --tree-path ../my-org-context
first-tree verify --tree-path ../my-org-tree
```

This fails if any items in `.first-tree/progress.md` remain
unchecked, and runs deterministic checks (valid frontmatter, node structure,
member nodes exist).

Do not run `first-tree verify` in the source/workspace repo itself. That repo
only carries the installed skill, the `FIRST_TREE.md` symlink, plus the
`FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` section.

### Step 4: Design Your Domains

Create top-level directories for your organization's primary concerns. Each needs a `NODE.md`:

```
my-org-tree/
  NODE.md              # root — lists all domains
  engineering/
    NODE.md            # decisions about architecture, infra, tooling
  product/
    NODE.md            # strategy, roadmap, user research
  marketing/
    NODE.md            # positioning, campaigns
  members/
    NODE.md            # team members and agents
    alice/
      NODE.md          # individual member node
```

### Step 5: Populate from Existing Work

For each domain, extract knowledge from existing repos, docs, and systems:

- Decisions and their rationale
- Cross-domain relationships and dependencies
- Constraints that aren't obvious from the code

The tree doesn't duplicate source code — it captures what connects things and why they were built that way.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `first-tree init` | Install local source/workspace integration and create or refresh a dedicated tree repo. By default, running in a source/workspace repo creates a sibling `<repo>-tree`; existing bound `<repo>-context` repos are still reused. Use `--here` only when you are already inside the dedicated tree repo, and `--seed-members contributors` to draft member nodes from contributor history. |
| `first-tree publish` | Publish a dedicated tree repo to GitHub, record its URL plus local checkout guidance back in the source/workspace repo, and optionally open the source-repo PR. |
| `first-tree verify` | Check the installed progress file for unchecked items + run deterministic validation. Use `--tree-path` when invoking from another working directory. |
| `first-tree upgrade` | Refresh local source/workspace integration or dedicated tree metadata from the currently running `first-tree` npm package and generate follow-up tasks. Use `--tree-path` when invoking from another working directory. |
| `first-tree help onboarding` | Print this onboarding guide. |

---

## Upgrading the Framework

When the framework updates:

```bash
first-tree upgrade
```

`first-tree upgrade` refreshes the current install from the skill bundled with
the currently running `first-tree` npm package, preserves your tree content,
and generates follow-up tasks.

If you run `first-tree upgrade` in the source/workspace repo, it refreshes
only the local installed skill, the `FIRST_TREE.md` symlink, plus the
`FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` section.
Run `first-tree upgrade --tree-path ../my-org-tree` to upgrade the
dedicated tree repo itself. If your source/workspace repo is already bound to
`../my-org-context`, use that actual legacy path instead. Dedicated tree repos
keep their progress checklist under `.first-tree/progress.md`.

If your repo still uses the older `skills/first-tree/` or `.context-tree/` layouts,
`first-tree upgrade` will migrate it to the current installed layout first.

To pick up a newer framework release, first run a newer package version, for
example `npx first-tree@latest upgrade`, or update your global `first-tree`
install before running `first-tree upgrade`.
