# Source/Workspace Installation Contract

This reference defines what it means to "install and use first-tree" in an
existing source or workspace repository.

## Core Boundary

- The current source/workspace repo is **not** the Context Tree.
- The current source/workspace repo should carry only the installed
  `.agents/skills/first-tree/` and `.claude/skills/first-tree/` skill roots
  plus a single `FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` line in root `AGENTS.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- `NODE.md`, `members/`, and tree-scoped `AGENTS.md` content belong only in a
  dedicated `*-context` repo.
- If a task changes decisions, rationale, ownership, or constraints, update
  the dedicated tree repo rather than copying that material into the source
  repo.

## Agent Decision Rule

- Treat "install and use first-tree" in a source/workspace repo as a two-repo
  workflow: local integration in the current repo plus tree bootstrap in a
  sibling `*-context` repo.
- Do not run `context-tree init --here` in the source/workspace repo unless the
  user explicitly says that repo itself should become the Context Tree.
- If you cannot create the sibling repo locally, cannot push it to GitHub, or
  cannot add the submodule yet, pause and report the blocker. Do not fall back
  to creating `NODE.md`, `members/`, or tree-scoped `AGENTS.md` in the
  source/workspace repo.

## Default Agent Workflow

When an agent is asked to install first-tree for a source/workspace repo, the
default workflow is:

1. Run `context-tree init` from the current source/workspace repo.
2. Switch into the sibling dedicated tree repo named `<repo>-context`.
3. Draft the first tree version from the real codebase, docs, and ownership
   signals.
4. Run `context-tree publish --open-pr` from the dedicated tree repo. It will:
   create or reuse the GitHub `*-context` repo in the same owner/org as the
   source repo, push the tree, add it back to the source/workspace repo as a
   `git submodule`, and open the source-repo PR.
5. After publish succeeds, treat the source repo's submodule checkout as the
   canonical local working copy for the tree. The temporary sibling bootstrap
   checkout can be deleted when you no longer need it.

If the dedicated tree repo was initialized manually with `context-tree init --here`
and publish cannot infer the source repo, pass `--source-repo PATH`.

## Verification And Upgrade

- Do not run `context-tree verify` in the source/workspace repo. Verify the
  dedicated tree repo instead, for example
  `context-tree verify --tree-path ../my-repo-context`.
- Running `context-tree upgrade` in the source/workspace repo refreshes only
  the local installed skill plus the `FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` lines.
- Run `context-tree upgrade --tree-path ../my-repo-context` to upgrade the
  dedicated tree repo itself.
