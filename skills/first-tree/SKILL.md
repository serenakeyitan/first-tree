name: first-tree
description: Maintain the canonical `first-tree` skill and CLI distributed by the `first-tree` npm package. Use when modifying `first-tree` commands (`init`, `publish`, `verify`, `upgrade`, `help onboarding`), the installed skill payload under `assets/framework/`, maintainer references, or the build, packaging, test, and CI wiring that supports the framework.

# First Tree

Use this skill when the task depends on the exact behavior of the
`first-tree` CLI or the installed `.agents/skills/first-tree/` and
`.claude/skills/first-tree/` payloads that `first-tree init` ships to user
repos.

## Source Of Truth

- `skills/first-tree/` is the only canonical copy.
- `references/` holds the explanatory docs the skill should load on demand.
- `assets/framework/` holds the runtime payload that gets installed into user
  repos.
- `engine/` holds the canonical framework and CLI behavior.
- `scripts/` holds maintenance helpers for validating and running the skill.
- In maintainer docs, use `first-tree` for the CLI, `skills/first-tree/` for
  the bundled source path, and `.agents/skills/first-tree/` /
  `.claude/skills/first-tree/` for installed user-repo paths.

## When To Read What

1. Start with `references/source-map.md` to locate the right files.
2. Read the user-facing reference that matches the task:
   - `references/onboarding.md`
   - `references/about.md`
   - `references/source-workspace-installation.md`
   - `references/principles.md`
   - `references/ownership-and-naming.md`
   - `references/upgrade-contract.md`
3. Read the maintainer reference that matches the shell or validation surface:
   - `references/maintainer-architecture.md`
   - `references/maintainer-thin-cli.md`
   - `references/maintainer-build-and-distribution.md`
   - `references/maintainer-testing.md`
4. Open `engine/` when changing `init`, `verify`, `upgrade`, command routing,
   repo inspection, rules, runtime helpers, or validators.
5. Open `assets/framework/` only when the task changes shipped templates,
   workflows, prompts, examples, or helper scripts.
6. Open `tests/` when changing validation coverage or maintainer workflows.
7. Use `./scripts/run-local-cli.sh <command>` when you need to exercise the
   live CLI from this repo.

## Working Modes

### Maintaining `first-tree`

- Treat this repo as the distribution source for one canonical skill plus a
  thin CLI shell, not as a tree repo.
- Keep command behavior, validator behavior, shipped assets, maintainer
  references, and package shell aligned.
- If root README/AGENTS/CI text explains something non-obvious, migrate that
  information into `references/` and trim the root file back down.
- If you change runtime assets or skill references, run `pnpm validate:skill`.

### Working In A User Tree Repo

- When the task is to "install and use first-tree" in an existing
  source/workspace repo, start with
  `references/source-workspace-installation.md` and follow that workflow
  end-to-end before improvising.
- When a user asks to install first-tree for an existing source/workspace repo,
  the current repo keeps only the installed skill plus a
  managed `FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` section in `AGENTS.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md`, plus `FIRST_TREE.md`. Do not create `NODE.md`, `members/`, or
  tree-scoped `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` there.
- `first-tree init` defaults to creating or reusing a sibling dedicated tree
  repo when invoked from a source/workspace repo. It installs the bundled skill
  into the source/workspace repo, links `FIRST_TREE.md` to
  `.agents/skills/first-tree/references/about.md` there, and scaffolds tree
  files only in the dedicated tree repo. Use `--here` to initialize the current
  repo in place when you are already inside the tree repo.
- `first-tree publish --open-pr` is the default second-stage command after
  `init` for source/workspace installs. Run it from the dedicated tree repo
  once the initial tree version is ready to push.
- Never run `first-tree init --here` in a source/workspace repo unless the
  user explicitly wants that repo itself to become the dedicated Context Tree.
  `--here` is for when you have already switched into the `*-tree` repo (or an
  older dedicated `*-context` repo).
- `first-tree init --seed-members contributors` is an explicit bootstrap aid:
  it seeds `members/*/NODE.md` from GitHub contributors when available, and
  falls back to local git history when GitHub metadata is unavailable.
- `first-tree init` does not install this skill into the target tree repo.
  Dedicated tree repos keep `.first-tree/` metadata plus `NODE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `members/NODE.md`.
- The default source/workspace workflow is: run `first-tree init` from the
  source repo, draft the first tree version in `<repo>-tree`, then run
  `first-tree publish --open-pr` from that dedicated tree repo. If the source
  repo is already bound to a legacy `<repo>-context`, keep reusing that repo
  name instead of renaming it.
- After the initial scaffold is in place, treat `progress.md` as the source of
  truth for onboarding status. Before deep tree population, report
  setup/integration progress separately from tree-content baseline coverage,
  ask the user whether to continue, and if they confirm, expand the tree with
  wave-based parallel sub-tasks or subagents by top-level domain.
- After `first-tree publish` succeeds, treat the checkout recorded in the
  source/workspace repo's `.first-tree/local-tree.json` file as the canonical
  local working copy for the tree. The bootstrap checkout can be deleted when
  you no longer need it.
- For day-to-day tasks after publish, read `.first-tree/local-tree.json`
  first, update the recorded checkout, and use that copy for routine work. If
  the recorded checkout is missing, use the published tree repo URL from the
  managed `FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` section to create a temporary clone
  under `.first-tree/tmp/` inside the active source/workspace repo, then
  delete that temporary clone before finishing the task. Fall back to the
  sibling bootstrap checkout only before publish has recorded the GitHub URL.
- At task close-out, always ask whether the tree needs updating. If the task
  changed decisions, constraints, rationale, or ownership, send the tree PR
  first and then send the source/workspace code PR. If the task changed only
  implementation detail, skip the tree PR and send only the source/workspace
  code PR.
- If the dedicated tree repo was initialized manually with `first-tree init --here`
  and does not have bootstrap metadata yet, pass `--source-repo PATH` to
  `first-tree publish`.
- If permissions, auth, or local filesystem constraints block the dedicated
  repo workflow, stop and report the blocker. Do not fall back to in-place tree
  bootstrap in the source/workspace repo.
- `first-tree upgrade` refreshes the installed skill from the copy bundled
  with the currently running `first-tree` package. In a source/workspace repo
  it refreshes only the local skill, the `FIRST_TREE.md` symlink, plus the
  `FIRST-TREE-SOURCE-INTEGRATION:` section; upgrade the dedicated tree repo
  separately with `--tree-path`. Dedicated tree repos refresh only
  `.first-tree/`. To pick up a newer framework, run a newer package version
  first. It also migrates older repos that still use `skills/first-tree/`.
- The user's tree content lives outside the skill; the skill only carries the
  reusable framework payload plus maintenance guidance.
- The tree still stores decisions, constraints, and ownership; execution detail
  stays in source systems.

## Non-Negotiables

- Preserve the CLI contract that it scaffolds, prints task lists, and validates
  state; it does not fully automate tree maintenance.
- Keep shipped assets generic. They must not contain org-specific content.
- Keep decision knowledge in the tree and execution detail in source systems.
- Keep the skill as the only canonical knowledge source. The root CLI/package
  shell must not become a second source of framework semantics.
- Keep the CLI name written as `first-tree` in maintainer and user-facing
  docs so command examples stay aligned with the published package.
- Keep normal `init` / `upgrade` flows self-contained. They must work from the
  skill bundled in the current package without cloning the source repo or
  relying on network access.
- Make upgrade behavior explicit. If you change installed paths, update
  `references/upgrade-contract.md`, task text, and tests together.

## Validation

- Repo checks: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`
- Packaging check: `pnpm pack` when changing package contents or install/upgrade
  behavior
- Skill checks:
  - `pnpm validate:skill`
  - `python3 ./skills/first-tree/scripts/quick_validate.py ./skills/first-tree`
  - `bash ./skills/first-tree/scripts/check-skill-sync.sh`
