# Context Tree Source Map

This is the maintainer entrypoint for the `first-tree` source repo.

Read canonical decisions from the bound Context Tree first. Use the repo-local
docs below only for source-repo implementation details.

## Validation

| Path | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/init.test.ts` | Tree bootstrap and init wrapper behavior |
| `tests/cli-e2e.test.ts` | End-to-end CLI smoke coverage across repo, workspace, publish, and review workflows |
| `tests/publish.test.ts` | Publish orchestration |
| `tests/sync.test.ts` | Sync behavior and apply flow |
| `tests/thin-cli.test.ts` | Thin CLI smoke coverage |

## Notes

- Keep decision-grade knowledge in the bound Context Tree under
  `first-tree-skill-cli/`.
- Keep root `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` short and distribution-focused.
- Keep shipped user knowledge in `skills/first-tree/references/` (shared
  across all four skills; individual product skills have no `references/`
  of their own).
- Keep runtime metadata changes synchronized across tree nodes, local docs,
  tests, and code.
