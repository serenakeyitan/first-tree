# Context Tree Source Map

This is the maintainer entrypoint for the `first-tree` source repo.

Read canonical decisions from the bound Context Tree first. Use the repo-local
docs below only for source-repo implementation details.

## Engine Surface

| Path | Purpose |

| `src/products/tree/engine/verify.ts` | Tree verification |
| `src/products/tree/engine/sync.ts` | Drift detection, proposal generation, and apply flow |
| `src/products/tree/engine/runtime/binding-state.ts` | `source.json`, `tree.json`, and `bindings/` schema |
| `src/products/tree/engine/runtime/local-tree-config.ts` | Local tree config helpers (delegates to `source.json`) |
| `src/products/tree/engine/runtime/source-repo-index.ts` | Generated `source-repos.md` index plus root tree repo guidance |
| `src/products/tree/engine/runtime/source-integration.ts` | Managed `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` source integration block |
| `src/products/tree/engine/workspace.ts` | Child repo / submodule discovery |

## Validation

| Path | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/init.test.ts` | Tree bootstrap and init wrapper behavior |
| `tests/cli-e2e.test.ts` | End-to-end CLI smoke coverage across repo, workspace, publish, and review workflows |
| `tests/publish.test.ts` | Publish orchestration |
| `tests/sync.test.ts` | Sync behavior and apply flow |
| `tests/thin-cli.test.ts` | Thin CLI smoke coverage |
| `tests/skill-artifacts.test.ts` | Skill export and doc integrity |
| `tests/upgrade.test.ts` | Upgrade behavior |
| `tests/verify.test.ts` | Verification behavior |

## Notes

- Keep decision-grade knowledge in the bound Context Tree under
  `first-tree-skill-cli/`.
- Keep root `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` short and distribution-focused.
- Keep shipped user knowledge in `skills/tree/references/`.
- Keep runtime metadata changes synchronized across tree nodes, local docs,
  tests, and code.
