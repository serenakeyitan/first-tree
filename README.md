# first-tree

first-tree - The living source of truth for your team. Give your agent superpowers with just a skill.

`first-tree` publishes the `first-tree` CLI and bundles the canonical
`first-tree` skill used to bootstrap and maintain Context Tree repos. A
Context Tree is a **Git-native knowledge layer** for decisions, ownership, and
cross-domain relationships that agents and humans keep current together.

## Quick Start For Agents

Paste one of these into your agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any agent you are using) from the root you want to onboard. You only need to decide whether your team needs a new tree or should join an existing one. The agent should inspect the current folder and decide whether it is onboarding a single repo or a multi-repo workspace.

If you are the first person on your team to set up a Context Tree:
```text
Use the latest first-tree CLI (https://github.com/agent-team-foundation/first-tree). First run `first-tree tree inspect --json` to determine whether the current folder is a single repo or a multi-repo workspace. If it is a multi-repo workspace, treat it as one workspace and create a single shared Context Tree for all repos in the current folder by default, rather than creating one tree per repo. Then install the skill in the current repo or workspace root and complete the onboarding process by creating the appropriate new Context Tree setup for this team.
```

If your team already has a Context Tree:
```text
Use the latest first-tree CLI (https://github.com/agent-team-foundation/first-tree). First run `first-tree tree inspect --json` to determine whether the current folder is a single repo or a multi-repo workspace. If it is a multi-repo workspace, treat it as one workspace and connect all repos in the current folder to the same shared Context Tree by default, rather than binding each repo to its own separate tree. Then install the skill in the current repo or workspace root and complete the onboarding process by connecting this repo or workspace to the existing shared Context Tree at `https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-tree-repo-name>`.
```

## Install And Run

The npm package and installed CLI command are both `first-tree`.

- One-off use without installing globally:

  ```bash
  npx -p first-tree first-tree tree inspect --json
  npx -p first-tree first-tree tree init
  ```

- Global install:

  ```bash
  npm install -g first-tree
  first-tree tree init
  ```

- Show the installed CLI version:

  ```bash
  first-tree --version
  ```

- Show the command list:

  ```bash
  first-tree --help
  ```

## Onboarding Modes

`first-tree` now models onboarding with three explicit concepts:

- `source/workspace root` — the repo or folder where local agent integration is installed
- `tree repo` — the Git repo that stores `NODE.md`, domains, members, and decisions
- `binding` — the metadata that connects a source/workspace root to a tree repo

That model supports three first-class onboarding paths.

### Single Repo + Dedicated Tree

This remains the default for a normal Git repo:

```bash
first-tree tree init
```

The CLI:

- installs `.agents/skills/first-tree/` and `.claude/skills/first-tree/` in the source/workspace root
- adds `WHITEPAPER.md`
- updates `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
- creates or reuses a sibling `<repo>-tree` checkout
- installs the bundled `first-tree` skill in that tree repo if it is missing
- scaffolds the dedicated tree repo there
- writes binding metadata locally and in the tree repo

### Existing Shared Tree

If the user already has a shared Context Tree, bind to it instead of creating a
new sibling:

```bash
first-tree tree bind --tree-path ../org-context --tree-mode shared
```

Or let `init` do the same thing as a high-level wrapper:

```bash
first-tree tree init --tree-path ../org-context --tree-mode shared
```

If the tree is remote-only, pass `--tree-url`; `bind` / `init` will clone a
local checkout, ensure the tree repo has the bundled skill installed, and then
write the binding metadata in both locations.

### Workspace Root + Shared Tree

When the current root is a parent folder or root repo that contains child repos
or submodules, use one shared tree for all of them:

```bash
first-tree tree init --scope workspace --tree-path ../org-context --tree-mode shared --sync-members
```

Or create a new shared tree automatically:

```bash
first-tree tree init --scope workspace --sync-members
```

The workspace root gets its own local skill integration plus
`.first-tree/source.json` (with workspace members). Each discovered child repo is then bound as a
`workspace-member` to the same tree via `first-tree tree workspace sync`.

### Explicit Tree Bootstrap

If you are already inside the tree repo itself, use:

```bash
first-tree tree init tree --here
```

## Inspect First

`first-tree tree inspect --json` is the agent-friendly way to classify the current
folder before modifying anything. It reports:

- whether the root is a tree repo, source repo, workspace repo, or workspace folder
- discovered child repos / submodules
- existing `source.json`, `tree.json`, and local checkout state

## What Lives Where

```text
<source-repo-or-workspace>/
  .agents/skills/first-tree/
  .claude/skills/first-tree
  WHITEPAPER.md
  AGENTS.md
  CLAUDE.md
  .first-tree/
    source.json              # .first-tree/source.json (includes workspace members for workspace roots)
  ... source code or workspace folders ...

<tree-repo>/
  .agents/skills/first-tree/
  .claude/skills/first-tree
  .first-tree/
    VERSION
    progress.md
    tree.json                # .first-tree/tree.json
    bindings/                # .first-tree/bindings/
      <source-id>.json
    bootstrap.json           # legacy compatibility for older publish flows
  source-repos.md            # generated index of bound source/workspace repos
  NODE.md
  AGENTS.md
  CLAUDE.md
  members/
    NODE.md
  ... your tree domains ...
```

The source/workspace root is not the tree. It should never contain `NODE.md`,
`members/`, or tree-scoped `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`.

The tree repo stores canonical binding metadata in `.first-tree/bindings/` and
generates `source-repos.md` as the human/agent-friendly repo index, while
source/workspace roots keep local checkout guidance in `.first-tree/source.json`
plus their own source/workspace binding state.

## Package And Command

- The npm package is `first-tree`.
- The installed CLI command is also `first-tree`.
- The CLI dispatches into three products: `tree`, `breeze`, `gardener`.
  Run `first-tree --help` for the routing.
- The published package ships four skill payloads, each with the same
  name in the package and when installed into a user repo:
  - `skills/first-tree/` — entry-point skill: methodology, references,
    and routing to the product skills
  - `skills/tree/` — operational handbook for the `first-tree tree` CLI
  - `skills/breeze/` — operational handbook for the `first-tree breeze` CLI
  - `skills/gardener/` — operational handbook for the `first-tree gardener` CLI
- In this source repo, `.agents/skills/<name>/` and `.claude/skills/<name>/`
  are tracked symlink aliases back to the four `skills/<name>/` payloads
  so local agents resolve the same skills the package ships.
- `npx -p first-tree first-tree <product> <command>` is the recommended
  one-off entrypoint.

## Canonical Documentation

User-facing references ship in `skills/first-tree/references/` (installed in user
repos as `skills/first-tree/references/`) and are copied to user repos via
`first-tree tree init` / `first-tree tree bind`.

Canonical design and architecture knowledge for this project lives in the bound
Context Tree under `first-tree-skill-cli/`. Repo-local maintainer notes in
`docs/` are implementation-only and never ship.
